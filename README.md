# DS_team_project
Tasks to be completed:
sort the edges by distance and cost (bit confused on this one tbh)
Have it be able to find the shortest route from one airport to another (it outputs both the path itself and the total distance)
have it be able to find the shortest path between one airport and all other airports (Same deal as the last)
have it be able to find the shortest path between one airport and a destination given a certain number of stops
count and display all direct flight connections to each airport (count both inbound and outbound), sorted by most connections to least
create a seperate undirected graph G_u which when you have 1 directed edge you ignore distance and only look at cost and ignore distance while if there are 2 directed edges you keep the one with the lowest cost value ignoring distance.
Generate a minimal spanning tree using Prinâ€™s algorithm on G_u that outputs both the MST and the total cost
Repeat but with Kruskal's algorithm
create function to convert cvs files to txt (this approach may be changed)
